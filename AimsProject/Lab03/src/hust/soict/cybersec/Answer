In java, a normal swap method won't work because Java does not have passing-by-reference. To illustrate, the normal swap method will create a copy of two parameters then swap the value of these two values, finally dump it into the trash bin. Therefore, the actual two value will not be swapped. In my explicit swap method, it creates copies of two indexes then tells the computer to swap the places of two parameters in the array, thus resulting in a successful swap whether the two indexes are removed or not.
