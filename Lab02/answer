Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does java allow this ?

- The answer is no because the two constructors have the same method signature ( title and category are both String ). If you enter new DigitalVideoDisc("Handsome man"), Java cannot differentiate between those signatures and see one as a "duplicate method" of another. If the user does this, he or she will eventually encounter a compile-time error
